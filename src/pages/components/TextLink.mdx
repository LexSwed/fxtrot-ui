## TextLink

`Text` component as `anchor`. Enables additional props, such as `external` to ease the use and security of `target="_blank"`

```tsx preview
<TextLink textStyle="body-sm" href="https://random.dog/">
  Body style
</TextLink>
```

### External

```tsx preview
<Column gap="8">
  <TextLink href="https://random.dog/" external>
    Just external
  </TextLink>
  <p>
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy{' '}
    <TextLink href="https://random.dog/" external="icon">
      dog
    </TextLink>
    , but can't make it, or maybe can but we just don't know. And this will be a very looong link.
    <TextLink href="https://random.dog/" external>
      How? This is how? How how? This is how.
    </TextLink>
  </p>
</Column>
```

# Installation

Install component library in your React project

```bash
npm install @fxtrot/ui @stitches/react framer-motion
```

- `@stitches/react` is a CSS-in-JS library with best of class Developer Experience. The consumer of the `@fxtrot/ui` is expected to use the same library.
- `framer-motion` is used only in a few places within the `@fxtrot/ui` library for mount/unmount animations. However, it is expected to use `frmaer-motion` heavily to bring more joyful experience to the users.

# Setup

Wrap your application in `ThemeProvider`:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@fxtrot/ui';

const App = () => <ThemeProvider>{/* Your application here */}</ThemeProvider>;
```

`ThemeProvider` makes sure all portals are rendered in correct place and themed appropriately.

For Server Side Rendering use [`@stitches/react` recommendations](https://stitches.dev/docs/server-side-rendering).

`@fxtrot/ui` does not ship fonts, so you should install them yourself, for example including `link` into `<head>`:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

# Usage

Use components in your app.

```jsx
import { Box } from '@fxtrot/ui';

<Box p={2}>Content</Box>;
```

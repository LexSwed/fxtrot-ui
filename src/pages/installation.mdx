title: Installation and setup
---

# Installation

Install component library in your React project

```bash
npm install @fxtrot/ui
```

# Setup

Wrap your application in `ThemeProvider`:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@fxtrot/ui';

const App = () => <ThemeProvider>{/* Your application here */}</ThemeProvider>;
```

`ThemeProvider` makes sure all portals are rendered in correct place and themed appropriately.

`@fxtrot/ui` does not ship fonts, so you should install them yourself, for example including `link` into `<head>` using Google Fonts:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+Display:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

# Usage

Use components in your app.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@fxtrot/ui';

<Button variant="outline">Start</Button>;
```
